# Getting Started with AI-Assisted Development

## Overview

This library provides a systematic approach to AI-assisted software development, focusing on:
- Modular, task-specific AI interactions
- Structured workflow management
- Comprehensive development guidance

## Core Principles

1. **Modularity**: Break down complex development tasks into manageable, focused interactions
2. **Systematic Approach**: Use structured workflows to guide development
3. **Flexibility**: Adapt to different project types and development stages
4. **Continuous Validation**: Verify outputs at each stage of development

## Project Organization

The library is organized to support different aspects of software development:
- Prompt libraries for various development phases
- Workflow definitions to guide AI-assisted processes
- Metadata to provide context and usage guidelines

## Development Workflow Strategies

### Key Workflow Components
- Prompt-driven interactions
- Step-by-step development processes
- Continuous integration of AI assistance

### Workflow Characteristics
- Technology-agnostic approach
- Emphasis on incremental development
- Clear verification points
- Adaptable to different project contexts

## Best Practices

1. **Granular Interactions**: Break tasks into atomic, manageable steps
2. **Contextual Awareness**: Maintain comprehensive project context
3. **Iterative Validation**: Verify and validate at each development stage
4. **Documentation**: Maintain clear, comprehensive documentation
5. **Flexibility**: Adapt workflows to project-specific needs

## Getting Started

1. Understand the project's modular structure
2. Explore available prompts and workflows
3. Select appropriate tools for your development phase
4. Follow systematic, step-by-step processes
5. Continuously validate and document progress

## Using the Workflows

This library provides two main workflows to assist with AI-driven development: scaffolding new projects and adding new features to existing projects. These workflows are located in the `workflows` directory and are designed to be used with the aider AI coding assistant. 

### Scaffolding New Projects
1. Navigate to the `workflows` directory.
2. Follow the instructions in the [`project-scaffolding-sprint-workflow-chain.md`](../../workflows/assistant-specific/aider/sprint/project-scaffolding-sprint-workflow-chain.md) to set up a new project structure.
3. Use the prompts and guidelines provided to guide your development process.

### Adding New Features
1. Use the [`post-scaffolding-sprint-workflow-chain.md`](../../workflows/assistant-specific/aider/sprint/post-scaffolding-sprint-workflow-chain.md) to integrate new features into an existing project.
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions to ensure smooth feature integration.

> **⚠️ Important Note:**  
> This library is in the early stages of development. The workflows and prompts are currently in "beta" and have only been tested with the aider AI coding assistant. Future updates will include support for other AI coding assistants, such as Cursor and Codeium's Windsurf.

## Metadata Information

For detailed information about each prompt, including which LLMs the prompt has been tested with, refer to the metadata files. These files reside in the same directory as their prompts and follow the naming convention of the prompt's filename, but with a `.meta.md` extension.

## Continuous Improvement

- Regularly review and refine AI-assisted development strategies
- Stay updated with emerging AI development technologies
- Adapt workflows based on project experiences
- Share insights and improvements with the community
