# Metadata: Dependency Management Prompt

## AI Assistant Compatibility
- Tested With: 
  * Aider
  * LLM: Claude 3.5 Sonnet (October 22, 2024 release)
- Potential Compatible Assistants: 
  * Other Claude models
  * GitHub Copilot (with modifications)

## SDLC Phase
- Phase: Implementation
- Sub-Phase: Dependency Management
- Workflow: Pre-Implementation Dependency Resolution

## Complexity Rating
- Complexity: High
- Cognitive Load: Significant
- Technical Depth: Deep dependency analysis and compatibility understanding required

## Usage Guidelines
- Prerequisite: Story Analysis Complete
- Requires: 
  * Sprint Stories
  * Project Dependency Definition File (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
  * Current Technology Stack Information

## Prompt Characteristics
- Input Driven: Yes
- State Dependent: Yes
- Requires Contextual Awareness: Critical
- Mode Sensitive: Yes (switches between ask/code modes)

## Best Practices
- Always verify compatibility with existing dependencies
- Use exact versions, never ranges
- Treat existing dependencies as immutable
- Document all dependency decisions
- Maintain clean separation between analysis and implementation phases
- Update both documentation and dependency files

## Potential Challenges
- Missing or incomplete dependency information
- Version compatibility conflicts
- Circular dependencies
- Peer dependency resolution
- Breaking changes in dependency updates
- Mode switching complexity
- Maintaining consistency across dependency files

## Recommended Mitigation Strategies
- Strict version control (no ranges)
- Comprehensive compatibility testing
- Clear documentation of decisions
- Explicit mode switching instructions
- Verification steps for dependency updates
- Return path validation to implementation

## Version
- Current Version: 1.0.0
- Last Updated: 2024-11-29
- Stability: Experimental

## Integration Points
